          <h3>Who I Am ----------------------------------</h3>
          <p>
            Hello, my name is Saravanan. I completed BBA degree in 2020 and subsequently
            gained work experience in the garments sector for a few years.
            However, I decided to pivot my career and pursue my newfound
            interest in web development. I enrolled in a web development course
            at Skill Safari, where I honed my skills in various aspects of web
            development, with a focus on React.
            <br/><br/>
            During the course, I had the
            opportunity to work on numerous projects, allowing me to apply and
            solidify my knowledge. Now, I am actively seeking job opportunities
            to further my career growth and expand my expertise in the field of
            web development.
